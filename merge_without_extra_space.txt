Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of sizes n and m in non-decreasing order. 
Merge them in sorted order without using any extra space.
 Modify arr1 so that it contains the first N elements and modify arr2 so that it contains the last M elements.

void merge(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m) 
{ 
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(arr1[i]>arr2[0]){
            swap(arr1[i],arr2[0]);
        }
        sort(arr2,arr2+m);
    } 
    
}
