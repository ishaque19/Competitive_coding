Given a number N. 
The task is to check whether it is sparse or not.
 A number is said to be a sparse number if no two or more consecutive bits are set in the binary representation.
 
 bool isSparse(int n)
    {
        n&=(n<<1);
        return n?false:true;
            
    }
	
	only 0 is false all -ve and +ve are true in boolean.
