Given a string S consisting only '0's and '1's,  find the last index of the '1' present in it.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function lastIndex() which takes the string S as inputs and returns the last index of '1'. If '1' is not present, return "-1" (without quotes).

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

class Solution{
    public:
    int lastIndex(string s) 
    {
        for(int i=s.size()-1;i>=0;i--){
            if(s[i]=='1'){
                return i;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }

};
