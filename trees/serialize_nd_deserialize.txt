Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, 
or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
 You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, 
so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself

public:

    string serialize(TreeNode* root) 
    {
        return !root ? " null" : " " + to_string(root->val) + serialize(root->left) + serialize(root->right);
    }
	
    TreeNode* deserialize(string data) 
    {
        istringstream ss(data);
        return buildTree(ss);
    }
    
private:
    
    TreeNode* buildTree(istringstream& ss)
    {
        string s;
        ss >> s;
        
        if (s == "null")
			return NULL;
        
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(stoi(s));
        node->left = buildTree(ss);
        node->right = buildTree(ss);
            
        return node;
    }
};
