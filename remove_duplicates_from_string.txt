Given a string without spaces, the task is to remove duplicates from it.

Note: The original order of characters must be kept the same.

 Your task:
Your task is to complete the function removeDups() which takes a single string as input and returns the string. You need not take any input or print anything.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(|s|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(constant)

string removeDups(string S) 
	{
	    map<char,int> freq;
	    string res;
	    for(int i=0;i<S.size();i++){
	        if(freq[S[i]]==0){
	            res+=S[i];
	            freq[S[i]]++;
	        }
	    }
	    return res;
	}
};
